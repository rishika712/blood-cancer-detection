# 🧬 Blood Cancer Detection Using Deep Learning

This project implements a **blood cancer detection system** using **deep learning** techniques to classify blood smear images as cancerous or non-cancerous. It aims to assist early diagnosis and support healthcare professionals in identifying potential cases of leukemia or related blood cancers.

## 📌 Objective

- To automate the classification of microscopic blood smear images.
- To use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image-based binary classification.
- To provide a scalable solution that can be used for diagnostic support.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow / Keras
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Matplotlib, OpenCV, Scikit-learn
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
